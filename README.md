# Weather-App
Weather App using Tkinter & OpenWeatherMap API 

This is a **GUI-based Weather App** built with Python's `tkinter` library and the **OpenWeatherMap API**. It allows users to retrieve **real-time weather information** for any city around the world by simply entering the city name (and optionally a country code). The app displays the **current temperature, feels-like temperature, weather condition, humidity, wind speed**, and **local time** at the location. It also fetches and displays a corresponding **weather icon** for visual context.

The interface is clean and user-friendly, with all inputs and outputs presented clearly in a responsive layout. It includes a **"Get Weather" button** to fetch data and a **"Clear" button** to reset all fields. The app handles invalid inputs and API errors gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience.

This project demonstrates the use of API integration, image handling via `Pillow`, and structured GUI design in Python.
